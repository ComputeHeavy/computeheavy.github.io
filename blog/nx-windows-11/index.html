        <h1>DEP and NX Always Enabled for 64-bit Windows Processes</h1>

        <p>There is no any way to get an executable stack or heap (without <span>VirtualProtect</span>) in a program you compile on Windows 11. I did not know that hardware protection was always on, so I went about trying to disable DEP and NX on an executable I was working on. Spoiler, it does not work.</p>

        <p>If you want to follow along you'll need Visual Studio or the Visual Studio Build Tools installed for the the developer command prompt.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>The Background</h2>

            <p>Porting the <a href="https://pwn.college">pwn.college</a> (not affiliated) shellcode exercises to Windows right now. These challenges take some shellcode, place it in a stack variable, and run it. I initially thought the linker option <span>/NXCOMPAT:NO</span> would give an executable stack. When it did not I hit it with the old <span>VirtualProtect</span>, made the memory <span>EXECUTE_READWRITE</span>, and moved on with my life.</p>

            <p>Eventually I got curious how I could get an executable stack and dove a little deeper. That also led to questions about an executable heap.

            <h2>The System</h2>

            <p>Some of the documentation talked about the system DEP policy, so let's check that first. Open a Command Prompt as Administrator and check with <span>bcdedit</span>.</p>

bootmenupolicy          Standard
            </pre>

            <p>Note the <span>nx OptIn</span> line. Using <span>bcdedit /set nx OptOut</span> works. Due to Secure Boot through, I cannot set it to <span>AlwaysOff</span>. Secure Boot ruins all the fun.</p>

            <pre>
C:\Windows\System32>bcdedit /set nx alwaysoff
An error has occurred setting the element data.
The value is protected by Secure Boot policy and cannot be modified or deleted.
            </pre>

            <p>After some toil, I decided to switch Secure Boot off in BIOS and set NX to AlwaysOff. This requires a couple reboots.</p>

            <pre>
C:\Windows\System32>bcdedit /set nx alwaysoff
The operation completed successfully.
            </pre>

            <p>There is also the Exploit Protections menu. Since Windows messed around with Control Panel (perfect) and added Settings (awful), which is kind of like Control Panel Lite, who knows what this changes. Let's set DEP to off though.</p>

            <p><img src="exploit-protections.png"></p>

            <p>We also add a program specific override.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>The Tools</h2>

            <p>We are also going to compile with the linker flag <span>/NXCOMPAT:NO</span> and verify that the NX compatibility is not set on the binary with <span>dumpbin</span>.

            <p>What clued me off that this might just be impossible is when I came across the API <span>SetProcessDEPPolicy</span>. The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setprocessdeppolicy">documentation</a> reads: <span>If the DEP system policy is OptIn or OptOut and DEP is enabled for the process, setting dwFlags to 0 disables DEP for the process.</span> Let me tell you though, it does not.</p> 

            <p>Once I read those docs in more detail, I saw <span>If this function is called on a 64-bit process, it fails with ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED.</span></p>

            <p>Once I read that I started to believe my efforts had been in vain (they had), so I went searching a little more. This <a href="https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SupportArticles-docs/blob/main/support/windows-client/performance/determine-hardware-dep-available.md">support article</a> states <span>In 64-bit versions of Windows, hardware-enforced DEP is always enabled for 64-bit native programs. However, depending on your configuration, hardware-enforced DEP may be disabled for 32-bit programs.</span> So it looks like all the DEP and NX options only apply to 32-bit processes.</p>

            <h2>Test Program</h2>

            <p>First, I would like to apologize. I just started this company and cannot afford syntax highlighting at this time.</p>

            <p>This program queries a pointer for its memory protections and prints them out. It declares a stack pointer and a heap pointer and sets them up with a nop sled (<span>0x90</span>) and return (<span>0xC3</span>). <i>Note, x86/64 opcodes, will not work on ARM.</i> The program then prints out their memory protections.</p>

            <p>Following that, we crash our program by casting our memory regions as function pointers and calling them. The commented out <span>VirtualProtect</span> calls are there so you can verify that these do run when the stack and heap regions are <span>EXECUTE_READWRITE</span>. Finally, there is a cute little print statement so we can see if the regions ran to completion.</p>

            <h2>The End</h2>

            <p>I dove into this thinking it would be possible to get an executable stack and heap on modern Windows. It was a ton of trial and error before I found a doc that explained that this was just the way of the world now. While it makes it impossible to make a trivial 64bit stack smash on Windows, it is for the best. This makes our computers more secure and our bugs more valuable.</p>
